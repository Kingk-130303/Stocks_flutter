An options contract offers the buyer the opportunity to buy or sellâ€”depending on the type of contract they hold. Each contract will have a specific expiration date by which the holder must exercise their option. The stated price on an option is known as the strike price. Call options allow the holder to buy the asset at a stated price within a specific timeframe. Put options, on the other hand, allow the holder to sell the asset at a stated price within a specific timeframe",
